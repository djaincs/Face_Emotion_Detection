                        Humans have always had the innate ability to recognize and distinguish between faces. Now
                        computers are able to do the same. This opens up tons of applications.

                        Computer vision (CV) is the field of study that helps computers to study using different
                        techniques and methods so that it can capture what exists in an image or a video. There are a
                        large number of applications of computer vision that are present today like facial recognition,
                        driverless cars, medical diagnostics, etc. We will discuss one of the interesting applications
                        of CV that is Emotion Detection through facial expressions. CV can recognize and tell you what
                        your emotion is by just looking at your facial expressions. It can detect whether you are angry,
                        happy, sad, etc.

                        In 2013, Ian Goodfellow along with his colleagues represented a paper in which he published
                        three different datasets, and one of them was <b>Face Emotion Recognition</b>.
